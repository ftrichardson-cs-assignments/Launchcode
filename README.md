# Launchcode

These are projects I completed as a bootcamp student at Launchcode, covering the fundamentals of web development up to Angular and React (https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-web-dev-curriculum/). My code is hidden to comply with Launchcode's plagiarism policy, but it is available upon request!
